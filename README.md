- 👋 Hi, I’m Juliette. I'm a PhD student in computational physics at LOMA in Bordeaux ! 
- 👀 I’m interested in Brownian motions and cool bacterias doing strange movements.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning saxophone, but also Python on a sort of advanced level. I am entirely self-taught, so I learnt to learn !
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any project involving MD or Langevin simulations. I find they are very graceful projects ! I aspire to leave an imprint on the physics of life.
- 📫 How to reach me : don't be shy ! Send me a message, email me at juliette.lacherez@u-bordeaux.fr, or stalk me anywhere and hmu for some talking.
